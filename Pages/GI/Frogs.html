        As ANY SANE PERSON would agree, frogs are truly beautiful and majestic creatures.<br>
        They come in many shapes and forms and are my absolute faves of the animal Kingdom &lt;3<br>
        Through this page I aim to analyse and document some particularly interesting specimens and get the deets for myself<br>
        And before you ask, yes these are in order of how cool I think they are :p<br>
        Toads and other like ampibia are more than welcome here too!<br><br><br>
